# Infrastructure

We use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to build our environments.

## Prerequisites

1. Install Terraform:

   ```bash
   brew install terraform
   ```

1. Install a Terraform version switcher:
   ([Terraform Switcher](https://github.com/warrensbox/terraform-switcher)
   or [CHTF](https://github.com/Yleisradio/homebrew-terraforms))

   ```bash
   brew install warrensbox/tap/tfswitch
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   brew install chtf
   ```

1. Select version 0.12.25:

   ```bash
   tfswitch 0.12.25
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   chtf 0.12.25
   ```

1. Install the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest):

   ```bash
   brew install azure-cli
   ```

1. Login to Azure:

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

1. Install [Kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize):

   ```bash
   brew install kustomize
   ```

## Development Environment

Infrastructure is set up so that each developer can create their own instance of the environment in Azure,
as opposed to sharing a staging environment.

1. Clone the FutureNHS Platform.

1. Set **your name** as a variable in your terminal, because we'll need to use it several times

   If your name is **John**, your commands might be as follows:

   ```bash
   FNHSNAME=john
   ```

1. Create the new dev environment with **your name** as the parameter.

   ```bash
   ./infrastructure/scripts/create-dev-environment.sh $FNHSNAME
   ```

1. Change directory into the dev environment folder:

   ```bash
   cd infrastructure/environments/dev
   ```

1. If you intend to use Synapse or PostgreSQL locally, add your IP to the list in terraform.tfvars

   ```hcl-terraform
   ip_whitelist_insights = {
     john = "123.45.678.90",
   }
   ip_whitelist_postgresql = {
     john = "123.45.678.90",
   }
   ```

1. Run Terraform Init using the vars file you just created:

   ```bash
   terraform init -backend-config=terraform.tfvars
   ```

1. Create an execution plan:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

1. After verifying the plan above, apply changes. The infrastructure will be created in Azure.

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

1. Give the Kubernetes cluster permissions to pull images from our Docker registry.

   ```bash
   az aks update -n dev-$FNHSNAME -g platform-dev-$FNHSNAME --attach-acr "/subscriptions/75173371-c161-447a-9731-f042213a19da/resourceGroups/platform-production/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/fnhsproduction"
   ```

1. In order to use Kubernetes CLI (kubectl) commands, you need to pull the credentials from the server.

   ```bash
   az aks get-credentials --resource-group platform-dev-$FNHSNAME --name dev-$FNHSNAME
   ```

1. To be able to read existing sealed secrets, you must add the sealed secret certificate to your cluster as a secret. Run the following to retrieve it from the Key Vault and apply to the cluster, and then add the controller:

   ```bash
   az keyvault secret show --vault-name "fnhs-shared-dev" --name "sealed-secret-yaml" | jq -r '.value'  | kubectl apply -f -
   ```

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f ./infrastructure/kubernetes/sealed-secrets/controller.yaml
   ```

   If everything works then your log should only contain:

   ```
   $ kubectl -n kube-system logs -l name=sealed-secrets-controller
   controller version: v0.12.4+dirty
   2020/07/21 14:52:04 Starting sealed-secrets controller version: v0.12.4+dirty
   2020/07/21 14:52:04 Searching for existing private keys
   2020/07/21 14:52:04 ----- sealed-secret-key
   2020/07/21 14:52:04 HTTP server serving on :8080
   ```

   If you see something about it failing to find a private key and generating one then you might need to recreate it.
   See https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/blob/master/docs/bring-your-own-certificates.md for details.

1. To install the [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/) control plane, run the `install-linkerd.sh` script that can be found within `infrastructure/scripts` directory.

   ```bash
   ./infrastructure/scripts/install-linkerd.sh dev-$FNHSNAME
   ```

   Once installed, view the Linkerd dashboard with the following command:

   ```bash
   linkerd dashboard &
   ```

1. Add your name and the instrumentation key printed by Terraform in the `infrastructure/dev-overlay-variables.json` and create a pull request.

1. Create your dev overlays locally by running the following script. Your overlays will also be created automatically in the deployments repository once your pull request from the previous step is merged.

   ```bash
   ./infrastructure/scripts/create-dev-overlays.py
   ```

1. To install [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/) run the `install-argo-cd.sh` script that can be found within `infrastructure/scripts` directory.

   ```bash
   ./infrastructure/scripts/install-argo-cd.sh dev-$FNHSNAME
   ```

   This will set up Argo CD on your cluster, and install the `argocd` command-line utility.

   The `argocd` command can connect to your Kubernetes cluster, but doesn't do this by default. This is quite annoying, so you will probably want to set this environment variable (run this once, and add it to your ~/.profile)

   ```bash
   export ARGOCD_OPTS='--port-forward --port-forward-namespace argocd'
   ```

   If you want to login, the username is `admin` and the password will be the name of the argocd-server pod, which you can get from:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n argocd
   ```

   ```bash
   argocd login --username admin --password $(kubectl get pods -n argocd | grep --only-matching 'argocd-server-[^ ]*')
   ```

   If you want to view the Argo CD UI, either do:

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
   ```

   and browse to http://localhost:8080.

   or do

   ```bash
   brew install kubefwd
   sudo kubefwd services -n argocd
   ```

   and browse to:

   ```
   https://argocd-server.argocd/
   ```

   If you want to see the frontend app browse to <https://fnhs-dev-$FNHSNAME.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com>.

1. Apply the ConfigMap for Azure Monitor for Containers to collect data in the Log Analytics workspace. The ConfigMap can be found in `infrastructure/kubernetes/logging` directory.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f ./infrastructure/kubernetes/logging/container-azm-ms-agentconfig.yaml
   ```

To reduce infrastructure costs for the NHS, please destroy your environment when you no longer need it.

```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Production environment

Production is a long-lived environment. To make changes, follow these steps.

The `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` environment variable is needed if you're using Azure CLI authentication and production is not your default subscription (which is recommended).

1. Change directory into the production environment folder:

   ```bash
   cd infrastructure/environments/production
   ```

1. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file that contains at least `ip_whitelist_postgresql = { yourname = "your.public.ip.adddress" }` (this is needed by the postgresql terraform provider).

1. Run Terraform Init using the vars file you just created:

   ```bash
   ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=75173371-c161-447a-9731-f042213a19da terraform init
   ```

1. Create an execution plan to setup the initial database and kubernetes cluster:

   ```bash
   ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=75173371-c161-447a-9731-f042213a19da terraform plan -target module.platform
   ```

1. After verifying the plan above, apply changes. The infrastructure will be created in Azure.

   ```bash
   ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=75173371-c161-447a-9731-f042213a19da terraform apply -target module.platform
   ```

1. Create an execution plan for the rest of the infrastructure:

   ```bash
   ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=75173371-c161-447a-9731-f042213a19da terraform plan
   ```

1. After verifying the plan above, apply changes. The infrastructure will be created in Azure.

   ```bash
   ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=75173371-c161-447a-9731-f042213a19da terraform apply
   ```

1. Set `ip_whitelist_postgresql = {}` in `terraform.tfvars` and re-run terraform apply, to remove yourself from the postgresql ip whitelist.

   ```bash
   ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=75173371-c161-447a-9731-f042213a19da terraform apply -target module.platform
   ```

1. Install Linkerd, Argo CD, and Sealed Secrets in the same way as it works for development environments.

   Change `kubectl` to point to the production cluster.

   ```bash
   kubectl config use-context production
   ```

   Install the applications.

   ```bash
   ./infrastructure/scripts/install-linkerd.sh production
   ./infrastructure/scripts/install-argo-cd.sh production
   kubectl apply -f ./infrastructure/kubernetes/sealed-secrets/controller.yaml
   ```

   And switch back to your own cluster.

   ```bash
   kubectl config use-context dev-matt
   ```

## Troubleshooting

1. If an error occurs when applying the terraform it is possible that there is a cached version of an existing terraform set up. You can overcome this by deleting the ./infrastructure/environments/dev/.terraform/ folder and trying again.
