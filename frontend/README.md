## Getting Started

## How to use


Frontend development server relies on some services that are available in the development cluster. Specifically, it calls out to the hello-world service when doing server-side rendering, and also proxies `/hello/*` to `http://hello-world.hello-world/hello/*` like how our nginx ingress does in production.

In order to set up a development cluster, see ../infrastructure/README.md. Once your development cluster is set up, you should run this to make the cluster's services available for local development:

```bash
sudo kubefwd services -n hello-world -n frontend -n argocd
```

Once that is running, start the dev server like this:
```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
